# OSCAL REST API Definition

This is an open-source REST API specification for exchanging [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) content between tools and organizations.

The _OSCAL REST OpenAPI Specification_ addresses OSCAL XML, JSON and YAML content for all seven OSCAL models. Each OSCAL model has a primary set of REST API methods and endpoints for the OSCAL content itself, as well as methods and endpoints for snapshots and attachments. OSCAL profiles also have methods and endpoints for live profile resolution and snapshots of resolved profiles.

The _OSCAL REST OpenAPI Specification_ is expressed using [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) 3.1.

## Conventions and Organization

All endpoint syntax is provided as:

|`METHOD /{model-name}`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}/snapshot`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}/snapshot/{identifier}`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}/attachment`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}/attachment/{resource-uuid}`<br />`METHOD /{model-name}/{identifier}/attachment/{resource-uuid}/resource`|
|:--- |

The `{model-name}` is always one of the seven root-level OSCAL model names exactly as they are defined in the OSCAL syntax. Simply replace `{model-name}` with one of the following:

- `catalog`
- `profile`
- `component-definition`
- `system-security-plan`
- `assessment plan`
- `assessment-results`
- `plan-of-action-and-milestones`

Profiles have additional endpoints related to profile resolution:

|`METHOD /profile/{identifier}/resolved-catalog`<br />`METHOD /profile/{identifier}/resolved-snapshot`<br />`METHOD /profile/{identifier}/resolved-snapshot/{identifier}`|
|:--- |

## Known Issue: XML Expression

When the specification calls for OSCAL content to be accepted or returned, the content must be fully OSCAL valid. Even if the specification shows a non-compliant schema or example.

There is a known-issue that prevents proper expression of OSCAL XML content in OpenAPI.

XML elements have both _attributes_ and _children_. JSON elements only have _children_. There is no way to specify an element _attribute_ using a JSON schema.

All versions of the OpenAPI specification, up to and including 3.1, only accept JSON schema definitions. As a result all OpenAPI viewers and code generators incorrectly represent OSCAL XML element _attributes_ as element _children_.

## Viewing / Editing

The proposed OSCAL REST OpenAPI specification is expressed using the OpenAPI 3.1 standard:
